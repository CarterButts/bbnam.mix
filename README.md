Code to Fit a Multi-informant Bayesian Network Accuracy Model (BNAM) with Graph Mixture Priors

This simple R script contains the core function needed to reproduce the graph mixture prior BNAM of Butts (2014), along with the separate estimation of self-report and proxy reporting errors employed by Lee and Butts (2018,2020).  This function is based on the bbnam.actor function of the sna package for R, with which it will eventually be integrated.  (However, a stand-alone version may be useful in the interim.)
